The study of S. Yaradoddi et al. (2020) was focused to make bioplastic from food waste. Orange peel was chosen because of its high cellulose content and abundance. A bio-plastic film was made from orange peels using simple laboratory techniques. The film blends with glycerol as a plasticizer have indicated consistent and promising results. This has very good strength, flexibility, and degradability in soiling conditions, morphologically have a rough surface, and verifies the film's bio-degradability. Orange peels consist of hemicelluloses, starch, cellulose, lignin, pectin, soluble sugars, fat, ash, protein, and flavonoids.[1]
