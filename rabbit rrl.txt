	The depletion of fossil fuels turns the application of biofuel into an alternative fuel.  Conversion of cow manure into briquette is the alternative to re-utilizing valuable chemicals in cow manure.  This study aims to observe the suitable temperature for the briquetting of cow manure as a solid biofuel.  The process involved drying, pulverizing, carbonation, and briquetting of cow manure.  Some analyses on briquettes are performed namely proximate analysis, and compressive and caloric value tests.  Preliminary observations indicated that carbonation at 300 °C able to densify the cow manure into briquette as a solid biofuel.  (Mitan, N. M. M., & Badarulzaman, S., 2020). [1]

	From the study of Hamid, et al. (2021), the main objective of their study is to increase the potential and beneficial uses of livestock waste of cow manure as a cheaper and eco-friendly BBQ briquettes (Briqmure) as an alternative household fuel energy.  Briqmure were produced from cow manure that was considered as a livestock and agricultural wastes.  The method and process of Briqmure manufacturing were done according to the standard and improvised procedures.  Cow manure was collected, mixed with water, and finally treated with heat.  The cow manure mixture was put into the briquette molds to dry. The results show that Briqmure made from cow manure has good combustion capacity.  The cost analysis carried out shows the economic viability of using the Briqmure as an outstanding, low cost and eco-friendly substitute of the current practices using conventional cooking fuels available.  Therefore, the utilization of cow manure for Briqmure production will reduce environmental degradation and pollution by minimizing cow manure waste in the livestock and agricultural industry. [2]

	According to Anatasya et al. (2019), biomass briquettes have been made as an alternative energy source from cow dung waste.  Molasses and starch were used as binder material with a carbonation temperature of 400 °C for 2 hours.  The work aims to produce biomass briquettes with the best heating value based on analysis of composition effect and type of binder on the briquette with calorific value.  The heat test results showed that briquettes with 10% sugar cane binding content produced the highest calorific value of 3907.5 calories/gram.  Sugar cane drops become the better binder than starch in biomass briquettes production. [3]

	Particle size is a physical property that sometimes limits the quality of briquettes, so it is recommended to use different sizes in mixtures for their manufacture.  The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of different particle sizes of sawdust in mixtures on some physical, mechanical, and energetic properties of briquettes made from Pinus durangensis sawdust, as well as set the ranges within the appropriate values found to obtain desired values.  The selection of different particle sizes for the mixtures increases the quality of the briquettes.  (Zepeda-Cepeda, C. O., et al., 2021). [4]

	Urban wood waste and poultry litter are solid wastes with potential for energy generation.  A well-modeled briquetting process can be used to find an ideal relationship between the control and response variables.  This study aimed to investigate the energy potential of biomass and the relationship between the following input variables: compression load (L), compaction time (T), granulometry (G), and the proportion of poultry litter mass and urban wood waste (Pl, 0:100; 25:75; 50:50; 75:25; 100:0) on the response variables, that is, higher heating value (HHV), density (D), and moisture content (MC) of the briquettes.  (Marreiro, H. M., et al., 2024). [5]

	In the study of Fiza, M., et al. (2020), problems faced by urban terrain are the lack of knowledge about the processing of fecal droppings.  Revenues are only based on the results of the processing into fertilizer tin ja still less to be the right solution.  Solutions that can be offered is the processing of waste into bio-coal briquettes using basic ingredients that keep piling up feces in the city.  The purpose of this study is to introduce the public or partners Community Partnership Program (CRP) on the processing of bio-coal briquettes made from feces as an alternative solution to the problems faced by the community, and an alternative business potential that can be developed by government companies that deal with this water.  The method applied in overcoming these problems is through counselling, training with demonstrations of bio-charcoal briquette processing, as well as coaching and mentoring into a product ready for market.  The activities consist of participatory extension coupled with the demonstration of processed briquettes of goat manure and pecan shells as well as packaging and testing the quality of the briquettes. [6]

	There is a lot of promise for the creation of briquettes made of wood dust, rice husks, and cow manure as alternative fuels.  The water content (%) and ash content (%) were measured in this study.  Carbon ratio (%), value calorific (cal/g), briquettes’ percentage of volatile content and their compressive strength (g/cm2).  A financial feasibility analysis of briquettes was also conducted as part of this study.  Overall, the briquettes’ financial feasibility study is really promising, which indicates the value of continuing this project.  It is believed that by using these briquettes, the amount of deforestation would decline and the dependence on firewood will decrease.  We may protect biodiversity and ecosystems by protecting forests.  (Athaillah, T., et al., 2024). [7]
