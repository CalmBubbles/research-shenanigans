The depletion of fossil fuels turns the application of biofuel into an alternative fuel. Conversion of cow manure into briquette is the alternative to reutilizing valuable chemicals in cow manure. This study aims to observe the suitable temperature for the briquetting of cow manure as a solid biofuel. The process involved drying, pulverizing, carbonization, and briquetting of cow manure. The carbonization of cow manure took place at three different temperatures; 300 °C (C300), 500 °C (C500), and 700 °C (C700). Some analyses on briquettes are performed namely proximate analysis, and compressive and caloric value tests. The calorific value for carbonization briquette of 300, 500, and 700 °C were 2434, 2402, and 2372 cal/g respectively. The carbonization of cow manure at 300 °C produced the highest calorific value of briquette. Therefore, preliminary observations indicated that carbonization at 300 °C able to densify the cow manure into briquette as a solid biofuel.[1]

The paper of Stolarski et al. shows the quality and cost of small-scale production of briquettes, made from agricultural and forest biomass in north-eastern Poland. The experiment involved production of eight types of briquettes. The highest net calorific value was determined for briquettes made from pine sawdust (18,144 MJ t−1). The value measured for briquettes made from perennial energy plants was over 1500 MJ t−1 lower, and for those made from straw 2000 MJ t−1 lower than for sawdust briquettes. The sawdust briquettes left significantly the lowest amount of ash (0.40% of dry mass). The significantly highest content of hydrogen, sulphur and nitrogen was found in briquettes containing the highest portion of rapeseed oilcake. The quality of briquettes varied and only some of them met the requirements of DIN 51731. Briquettes made from pine sawdust were of the highest quality. The briquette production cost ranged from 66.55 € t−1 to 137.87 € t−1 for rape straw briquettes and for those made from a mixture of rape straw and rapeseed oilcake (50:50), respectively. In general, briquette production was profitable, except for the briquettes made from a straw and rapeseed oilcake mixture.[2]

From the study of Hamid et al., the main objective of their study is to increase the potential and beneficial uses of livestock wastes of cow manure as a cheaper and eco-friendly BBQ briquettes (Briqmure) as an alternative household fuel energy. Briqmure were produced from cow manure that was considered as a livestock and agricultural wastes. The method and process of Briqmure manufacturing were done according to the standard and improvised procedures. Cow manure was collected, mixed with water and finally treated with heat. The cow manure mixture was put into the briquette molds to dry. The results show that Briqmure made from cow manure has good combustion capacity. The cost analysis carried out shows the economic viability of using the Briqmure as an outstanding, low cost and eco-friendly substitute of the current practices using conventional cooking fuels available. Therefore, the utilisation of cow manure for Briqmure production will reduce environmental degradation and pollution by minimising cow manure waste in the livestock and agricultural industry.[3]
