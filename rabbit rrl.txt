       The depletion of fossil fuels turns the application of biofuel into an alternative fuel.  Conversion of cow manure into briquette is the alternative to re-utilizing valuable chemicals in cow manure.  This study aims to observe the suitable temperature for the briquetting of cow manure as a solid biofuel.  The process involved drying, pulverizing, carbonation, and briquetting of cow manure.  The carbonation of cow manure took place at three different temperatures: 300 °C (C300), 500 °C (C500), and 700 °C (C700).  Some analyses on briquettes are performed namely proximate analysis, and compressive and caloric value tests.  The calorific value for carbonation briquette of 300, 500, and 700 °C were 2434, 2402, and 2372 cal/g respectively.  The carbonation of cow manure at 300 °C produced the highest calorific value of briquette.  Therefore, preliminary observations indicated that carbonation at 300 °C able to densify the cow manure into briquette as a solid biofuel.  (Mitan, N. M. M., & Badarulzaman, S., 2020) [1]

       From the study of Hamid et al. (2021), the main objective of their study is to increase the potential and beneficial uses of livestock wastes of cow manure as a cheaper and eco-friendly BBQ briquettes (Briqmure) as an alternative household fuel energy.  Briqmure were produced from cow manure that was considered as a livestock and agricultural wastes.  The method and process of Briqmure manufacturing were done according to the standard and improvised procedures.  Cow manure was collected, mixed with water and finally treated with heat.  The cow manure mixture was put into the briquette molds to dry. The results show that Briqmure made from cow manure has good combustion capacity.  The cost analysis carried out shows the economic viability of using the Briqmure as an outstanding, low cost and eco-friendly substitute of the current practices using conventional cooking fuels available.  Therefore, the utilization of cow manure for Briqmure production will reduce environmental degradation and pollution by minimizing cow manure waste in the livestock and agricultural industry. [2]


       According to Anatasya et al. (2019), biomass briquettes have been made as an alternative energy source from cow dung waste.  Molasses and starch were used as binder material with a carbonation temperature of 400 °C for 2 hours.  The work aims to produce biomass briquettes with the best heating value based on analysis of composition effect and type of binder on the briquette with calorific value.  The heat test results showed that briquettes with 10% sugar cane binding content produced the highest calorific value of 3907.5 calories/gram.  Sugar cane drops become the better binder than starch in biomass briquettes production. [3]
