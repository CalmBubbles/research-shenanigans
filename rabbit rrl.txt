	The depletion of fossil fuels turns the application of biofuel into an alternative fuel.  Conversion of cow manure into briquette is the alternative to re-utilizing valuable chemicals in cow manure.  This study aims to observe the suitable temperature for the briquetting of cow manure as a solid biofuel.  The process involved drying, pulverizing, carbonation, and briquetting of cow manure.  Some analyses on briquettes are performed namely proximate analysis, and compressive and caloric value tests.  Preliminary observations indicated that carbonation at 300 °C is able to densify the cow manure into briquette as a solid biofuel.  (Mitan, N. M. M., & Badarulzaman, S., 2020). [1]

	From the study of Hamid, et al. (2021), the main objective of their study was to increase the potential and beneficial uses of livestock waste of cow manure as a cheaper and eco-friendly BBQ briquettes (Briqmure) as an alternative household fuel energy.  Briqmure was produced from cow manure that was considered as a livestock and agricultural waste.  The method and process of Briqmure manufacturing were done according to the standard and improvised procedures.  Cow manure was collected, mixed with water, and finally treated with heat.  The cow manure mixture was put into the briquette molds to dry. The results show that Briqmure made from cow manure has good combustion capacity.  The cost analysis carried out shows the economic viability of using the Briqmure as an outstanding, low cost and eco-friendly substitute of the current practices using conventional cooking fuels available.  Therefore, the utilization of cow manure for Briqmure production will reduce environmental degradation and pollution by minimizing cow manure waste in the livestock and agricultural industry. [2]

	According to Anatasya et al. (2019), biomass briquettes had been made as an alternative energy source from cow dung waste.  Molasses and starch were used as binder material with a carbonation temperature of 400 °C for 2 hours.  The work aims to produce biomass briquettes with the best heating value based on analysis of composition effect and type of binder on the briquette with calorific value.  The heat test results showed that briquettes with 10% sugar cane binding content produced the highest calorific value of 3907.5 calories/gram.  Sugar cane drops become the better binder than starch in biomass briquettes production. [3]

	Particle size is a physical property that sometimes limits the quality of briquettes, so it is recommended to use different sizes in mixtures for their manufacture.  The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of different particle sizes of sawdust in mixtures on some physical, mechanical, and energetic properties of briquettes made from Pinus durangensis sawdust, as well as set the ranges within the appropriate values found to obtain desired values.  The selection of different particle sizes for the mixtures increases the quality of the briquettes.  (Zepeda-Cepeda, C. O., et al., 2021). [4]

	Urban wood waste and poultry litter are solid wastes with potential for energy generation.  A well-modeled briquetting process can be used to find an ideal relationship between the control and response variables.  This study aimed to investigate the energy potential of biomass and the relationship between the following input variables: compression load (L), compaction time (T), granulometry (G), and the proportion of poultry litter mass and urban wood waste (Pl, 0:100; 25:75; 50:50; 75:25; 100:0) on the response variables, that is, higher heating value (HHV), density (D), and moisture content (MC) of the briquettes.  (Marreiro, H. M., et al., 2024). [5]

	In the study of Fiza, M., et al. (2020), problems faced by urban terrain were the lack of knowledge about the processing of fecal droppings.  Revenues are only based on the results of the processing into fertilizer tin ja still less to be the right solution.  Solutions that can be offered is the processing of waste into bio-coal briquettes using basic ingredients that keep piling up feces in the city.  The purpose of this study is to introduce the public or partners Community Partnership Program (CRP) on the processing of bio-coal briquettes made from feces as an alternative solution to the problems faced by the community, and an alternative business potential that can be developed by government companies that deal with this water.  The method applied in overcoming these problems is through counselling, training with demonstrations of bio-charcoal briquette processing, as well as coaching and mentoring into a product ready for market.  The activities consist of participatory extension coupled with the demonstration of processed briquettes of goat manure and pecan shells as well as packaging and testing the quality of the briquettes. [6]

	There is a lot of promise for the creation of briquettes made of wood dust, rice husks, and cow manure as alternative fuels.  The water content (%) and ash content (%) were measured in this study.  Carbon ratio (%), value calorific (cal/g), briquettes’ percentage of volatile content and their compressive strength (g/cm2).  A financial feasibility analysis of briquettes was also conducted as part of this study.  Overall, the briquettes’ financial feasibility study is really promising, which indicates the value of continuing this project.  It is believed that by using these briquettes, the amount of deforestation would decline and the dependence on firewood will decrease.  We may protect biodiversity and ecosystems by protecting forests.  (Athaillah, T., et al., 2024). [7]

	Briquettes were produced from a combination of groundnut shell, rice husk, sawdust and wastepaper using the 20:70:10, 30:60:10, 40:50:10, 50:40:10, 60:30:10 and 70:20:10 ratio.  The feedstock of each blend was fed into a square mold [60mm] and screw pressed.  Moisture content, density, and combustion characteristics (ignition time and calorific value) of the briquettes were determined. Data obtained were analyzed using appropriate statistical tools.  The moisture content of all the briquettes ranged between 8 to 15%. The durability of the briquettes improved with increased starch proportion.  (Akpenpuun, T. D., et al., 2020). [8]

	Physico-mechanical characteristics of briquettes produced from composite sawdust admixture using a screw press briquetting machine was investigated.  Briquette’s physical characteristics investigated using standard test apparatus and procedures include dimensional stability immediately, 1 hour and 30 days after production, effects of particle moisture and particle size on briquette compressed and relaxed densities.  Mechanical characteristics include resistance to gravity and impact, effects of densities on impact resistance index (IRI) and effects of briquette durability in water.  Statistical models were used to establish empirical relationships between the feedstock materials (independent variables) and briquette characteristics (independent variables).  The compressed density of the briquettes ranges of 490-820 kg/m3.  The lower moisture briquettes have high resistance to water dispersion, high impact resistance and excellent storability, as said from the study of Bello, R. S., et al. (2020). [9]

	The study of Zhang, G., et al. (2018) says that briquette binder plays a key role in the process of briquette production.  The quality and performance of briquette also depend on the quality of briquette binder.   Different types of briquettes need different briquette binders. Binder used in briquetting process can be divided into inorganic binder, organic binder, and compound binder.  Inorganic binders have many excellent advantages, such as abundant resource, low cost, excellent thermos-ability, and good hydrophilicity. [10]

	Briquette performance depends on the types and nature of binders used during the preparation and densification process.  Most of the performance-related problems such as low yield and energy content can be significantly improved with the use of binders in the right proportions.  This review discusses the state-of-the-art of fuel briquettes and the influence of binder’s properties on the combustion characteristics, energy content, mechanical durability, and density of fuel briquettes.   The compatibility between the binders and the fuel briquettes to obtain a better yield is also discussed with the resulting mechanical and combustion properties. The mechanical durability of fuel briquettes can be improved by reducing the content of lignin, fat, and other extractives in the binder, as well as improving the binder’s variables such as the particle size, texture, and quantity.  (Olugbade, T., et al., 2019). [11]

	Charred briquettes production is a sustainable way of producing cooking fuel from waste.  This study determined the potential of charred briquettes of sawdust, rice, and coconut husks in meeting cooking energy needs of households.  In a further step, the acceptability of biomass users in the study to replace their current fuels with charred briquettes was established.  This study established that briquette is a suitable replacement for wood and charcoal, if its full potential is harnessed and the energy utilization efficiency of biomass (sawdust, rice, and coconut husks) briquettes is confirmed.  (Akolgo, G. A., et al., 2021). [12]

	Briquettes are widely used as a renewable energy to solve the problems of excessive use of wood as fuel.  However, the performance of briquettes depends on the types of pyrolysis and the nature of binders used during the preparation.  Their performances are related to problems such as low yield and energy content but can be significantly improved with the use of adhesives in the right compositions, from the study of Wirabuana, A. D., et al. (2021). [13]

	The objective of Kongprasert, N., et al.’s (2019) study was to manufacture charcoal briquettes from agricultural wastes and investigate the properties of these briquettes.  Madan wood (MW) and coconut shell (CS) were used as raw materials in this work.  Two types of crushed charcoal were mixed with cassava starch and molded before they were air-dried.  Four different mixing ratios of charcoal powder from Madan wood and coconut shell: MW (100%), MW:CS (80%:20%), MW:CS (50%:50%) and CS (100%) were used in this research.  Following the ASTM standard, each type of charcoal briquettes was characterized and analyzed for their physical-chemical properties including moisture content, volatile matter content, ash content, fixed carbon, calorific value, bulk density, burning rate and heat utilization efficiency.  The results revealed that charcoal briquettes made from Madan wood (100%) had the highest calorific value of 6,622 cal/g.  Madan wood waste could be considered as a potential renewable raw material to manufacture briquette as alternative energy source. [14]

	It is necessary to think together is how to save energy in addition to looking for alternative energy sources to reduce dependence on petroleum.  So, this requires creative efforts to use horse dung into bioarang briquettes.  Bioarang briquettes are a renewable and environmentally friendly alternative energy source.  The raw material in this study used dried horse manure with a drying percentage of 26.4%.  Furthermore, horse manure mixed with starch with the ratio between horse manure and starch is 3:1.  Next, the mixture is pressed to obtain biomass briquettes then dried under the sun for 3 days. so that the percentage of drying is obtained at 59.3%, then processed into bioarang through the pyrolysis process.  The pyrolysis process is carried out using a heating.  The results showed that the gross energy of bioarang briquettes increased by an average of 3% for every 0.5 hour increase in the length of the pyrolysis process, while the water content of bioarang briquettes decreased by 0.5%. (Sujita, S., 2021). [15]
