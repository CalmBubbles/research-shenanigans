I.	Title: Bioplastic out of Calamansi (Citrus microcarpa) Peels 
II.	General Objective: To reduce the pollution from non-biodegrable plastic. 
III.	Specific Objectives:
	Encourage people to use the bioplastic out of calamansi peels.
	To know if calamansi peels can be accepted as bioplastic.
	To test if calamansi peels are effective to be made as bioplastic. 
IV.	Statement of the Problem: The study focuses on the production on of Calamansi Peels as bioplastic. The research aims to answer the following:
1.	Durability;
2.	Heat Resistance;
3.	Flexibility;
V.	Hypothesis: This study is based on the following null and alternative hypothesis according to the statement of the problem, the hypotheses are:
     Null Hypothesis: Calamansi (Citrus microcarpa) peels has no
     significant effect as bioplastic. 
     Alternative Hypothesis: Calamansi (Citrus microcarpa) peels 
     has significant effect as bioplastic. 
VI.	Background of the Study:
                Bioplastics are plastics made from renewable biomass resources. Bioplastic is a plastic made from polymers from biological sources such as starch and cellulose. Bioplastics' benefits include reduced use of fossil fuel resources, a smaller carbon footprint, and faster decomposition. Bioplastic is also less toxic. Plastics provide conveniences, however it has resulted in a throw-away culture that made single-use plastics one of the largest source of pollution. Biodegradable plastics may reduce the burden on our existing waste systems while also having socioeconomic benefits. Plastic pollution has emerged as one of the most pressing environmental issues.
