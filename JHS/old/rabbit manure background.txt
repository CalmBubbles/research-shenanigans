Organic matter such as rabbit manure improves poor soil structure, drainage, and moisture retention. It is not as stinky as other manures and is easy to use. In one year, a female rabbit and her offspring can produce a ton of manure. Manure is an organic waste produced by cows, buffaloes, rabbits, horses, pigs, chickens, and poultry. It can be hazardous to the environment if not treated separately. If more people start using briquettes, which are more sustainable and energy-efficient, pressure on forests may be relieved and pollution levels in cities may decrease. Briquettes are a good fit for circular bioeconomy strategies that maintain rural-urban ties while reducing waste and promoting more sustainable bioresources and market-based activities.
